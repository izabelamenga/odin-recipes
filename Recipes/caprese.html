    <h1>Caprese Salad</h1>
    <img src="./images/caprese.jpg"> 
    <h3>Recipe Story</h3>
    <p>Caprese salad is just about my favorite thing on earth. Thick slices of tomato and mozzarella flavored with fresh basil leaves, olive oil, and a beautiful balsamic reduction. It's so simple, but oh so impressive. Make it for a quick lunch at home, serve it with grilled steak kabobs for a fresh-tasting summer meal, or wow dinner guests with a full Italian-inspired feast. Think caprese salad, spaghetti and meatballs, and garlic cheese bread. Oh, and tiramisu for dessert? Now, I'm hungry. This salad will forever be a summertime favorite for me.



    </p>
    <p>For this Caprese, I used a simple balsamic reduction, which results in a pretty presentation and gorgeous flavor.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 c. balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>3 whole ripe tomatoes, sliced thick
        </li>
        <li>12 oz. mozzarella cheese, sliced thick
        </li> 
        <li>fresh basil leaves
        </li>
        <li>olive oil, for drizzling
        </li>
        <li>kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
        </li>
    
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring the balsamic vinegar to a boil over medium-low heat in a small saucepan. Cook for 10 to 20 minutes, or until the balsamic has reduced to a thicker glaze. Remove it from the heat and transfer to a bowl or cruet. Allow to cool.
        </li>
        <li>When you're ready to serve, arrange tomato and mozzarella slices on a platter. Arrange basil leaves between the slices. Drizzle olive oil over the top of the salad, getting a little bit on each slice. Do the same with the balsamic reduction, making designs if you want. Store extra balsamic reduction in fridge for a later use.


        </li>
        <li>End with a sprinkling of kosher salt and black pepper. Serve as a lunch, with crusty bread, or serve alongside a beef main course for dinner.
